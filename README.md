<p>Error: The neural net predictions function is using shallow_nn everytime instead of the model passed in, sorry about that! This changes the results a bit, but the main point is choosing and creating a model, which this doesn't impact.</p>

About Dataset
Context
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

Content
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

Given the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* Tensorflow
  ```sh
  pip install tensorflow
  ```
* scikit-learn
  ```
  pip install -U scikit-learn
  ```
  In order to check your installation you can use
  ```
  python -m pip show scikit-learn  # to see which version and where scikit-learn is installed
  python -m pip freeze  # to see all packages installed in the active virtualenv
  python -c "import sklearn; sklearn.show_versions()
  ```
* Pandas & Numpy
  ```
  pip install pandas
  pip install numpy
  ```
* Kaggle
  ```
  pip install kaggle
  ```

### Installation

1. Create new API Token from your [Kaggle Account](https://www.kaggle.com/)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dogukanuykun/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git
   ```
3. Download the [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
